###Build a Hotel Website in Minutes

This plugin enables the publication of data entered via Appy Hotel's proprietary [backend] directly to any Wordpress based website. The plugin and accompanying themes enable hotels and website developers to deploy, with just a few clicks, fully featured hotel websites. 

###Manage Your Hotel's Website and Apps From a Single Dashboard
Websites generated this way are managed using the Appy Hotel dashboard and are therefore always in synch with apps generated via the platform. 
Appy Hotel = 1 management dashboard, all the screens you need

###How it works
Installing and activating the plugin and theme, and entering a valid Appy Hotel ID and API key in the settings page will immediately pull, structure and publish all the content entered for that hotel onto the Wordpress installation. 

Use [Appy Hotel's provided responsive themes], or style your own to create a stunning Hotel website, fully integrated with the hotel's mobile apps and managed via the same dashboard.
